# CSCI4409_Bakers_Go
Implementing the bakers algorithm in go for fun

### How to run:
I'm going to assume you have a go environment set up already, if not then: https://golang.org/doc/install

Compile with `go install`
Run the binary with two command line arguments, the first being the number of servers you want, and the second
being the number of customers you want.
